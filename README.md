# Space Shooter

**Space Shooter** is a space shooter game developed using the GameMaker Language (GML), where you defend your spaceship against waves of menacing alien invaders. This is my first game project, and it has been an exciting journey while learning to program. The main goal was to create a version optimized for mobile devices, especially Android.

## üöÄ Introduction

This project aims to provide an exciting and challenging gaming experience where players embark on an intergalactic adventure, facing increasingly difficult enemies. While the primary focus is on Android, there is still a lot of room for improvements and optimizations, especially to enhance performance on mobile devices.

**Note:**  
It is possible to compile for Android, but I haven‚Äôt included a version here because I lost the entire configuration I made to run it on my phone before uploading the build, and I‚Äôm currently short on time. The game still requires a lot of optimization to ensure good performance on mobile devices. However, it is playable using GameMaker (just avoid using the Linux version).

In *Space Shooter*, you defend your spaceship from waves of alien invaders. As you progress, the game becomes more challenging, with stronger enemies and many opportunities to upgrade your ship with power-ups and upgrades.
